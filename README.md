# HyprDots

A fully repeatable desktop environment built on Arch using Hyprland

  
  

Welcome! My goal with this repository was to provide myself with a personal development that is repeatable and managed by source control. This allows me to make changes, test them, throw them away and move them to a new machine / fresh install with minimal post-setup.
